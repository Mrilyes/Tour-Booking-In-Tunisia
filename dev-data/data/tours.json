Along the way, fans of archeology will appreciate the site of Oudna, a Punic city that has become Roman. The so-called “Laberii” villa with its thirty rooms on 2,300 m² deserves a special visit for its mosaics, an archaeological site well preserved includes an astonishing amphitheater that could once accommodate 20,000 spectators. Then we will visit the Andalusian medina of Zaghouan, to finish with Thuburbo Majus, an ancient city that experienced a decline in the middle of the third century before a brilliant renaissance in the fourth century, leading it to proclaim itself Respublica Felix Thuburbo Majus. The vandal invasion, in the middle of the fifth century, put an end to the prosperity of the city and brought it back to the rank of a town which soon after the Arab conquest was deserted.",
