I booked a half day tour with Saharansky to see Sidi Bou Said and Carthage with a private tour guide and driver. Our tour guide was Kais and our driver was Saif. Both were wonderful. Kais helped us understand the history, culture and wonders of Tunisia. Saif was great as well, the air conditioned car was welcome during the 35 degree heat and humidity. We had such a great time we booked a cooking class the next day with Irina and a local Tunisian woman in her home. Saif was our driver again. Irina took us grocery shopping (the souk was closed the day we took the class). We made cous cous, Slata Mechoia (roasted red pepper and tomato sauce) and Brick (fried squares with filling). It was wonderful to see a Tunisian household, she was so welcoming, giving and warm, and made us feel at home. She even gave us some cous cous to take home with us. We ate so much we couldn‚Äôt eat dinner! Thank you Saharansky for making our trip!",

Also visits to a star wars site, the Colosseum of El jem and finally an oasis with hot spring !! They are friendly, honest, very nice you can trust them!
